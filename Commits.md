Commit Topic: Added main entry point and game panel classes
This commit introduces the initial setup for the game application, including the main entry point and the game panel for rendering graphics in the main package:

1. Created Main.java:
    - Print Statement: Prints 'Hello world!' to the console.
    - JFrame Initialization:
        - Initializes a JFrame window titled 'Simple Chess Game'.
        - Configured to not be resizable and to exit the application when closed.
    - GamePanel Addition:
        - Creates an instance of GamePanel.
        - Adds the GamePanel instance to the JFrame.
    - Window Configuration:
        - Packs the window to fit the size of its components.
        - Centers the window on the screen.
        - Sets the window to be visible.

2. Created GamePanel.java:
    - Class Extension: Extends JPanel to create a custom panel for the game.
    - Dimensions: Sets the dimensions to 1100x800 pixels.
    - Background Color: Sets the background color to black.

These additions lay the foundation for the game's GUI and rendering logic.
